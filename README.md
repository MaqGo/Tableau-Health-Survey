# Tableau Health Survey
# BMI and Life Expectancy Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive Tableau Public dashboard that explores the relationship between BMI, life expectancy, and continents/countries over time. The visualizations help uncover trends and patterns in global health metrics.

# 📊 Dashboard Highlights
Scatter Plot:

Shows the correlation between average BMI and average life expectancy.

Data points are color-coded by continent for easy comparison.

Trend lines for each continent illustrate distinct patterns.

Map Visualization:

Displays average BMI values geographically.

Provides a global perspective on BMI distribution.

Interactive Filters:

Filter by continent to analyze regional differences.

Hover for detailed country-level insights.

# 🗂️ Contents
Sheets Included:

BMI & Life Expectancy over Continents and Countries

BMI by Years, Gender, and Continents

Additional sheets on cancer data and population counts (future expansion)

## 📊 Key Findings

Based on the visualizations created in this project:

✅ **Regional Variation:**  
There are clear geographic patterns in key health indicators such as smoking prevalence, obesity rates, and physical activity levels.

✅ **High-Risk Areas:**  
Certain states or regions show consistently higher rates of chronic diseases and risk factors.

✅ **Opportunities for Intervention:**  
Data visualization helps identify target areas where public health interventions could have the greatest impact.

✅ **Data-driven Storytelling:**  
Symbol maps make it easy to compare regions at a glance, highlighting disparities that may otherwise be overlooked.
